Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "2016",
       y = "2020",
       title = "Republican Margins of Victory",
       caption = "Point Percentages per County, 2016 and 2020")
```
