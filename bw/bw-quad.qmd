Hide the code, hide the error message, fix axes, add alt text (description), and fix caption (source of data, author of viz, date created)

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}

  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red" = "red", "blue" = "blue", "purple" = "purple")) +
  scale_size_area() +
  labs(x = "2016",
       y = "2020",
       title = "Republican Margins of Victory",
       caption = "Point Percentages per County, 2016 and 2020",
       color = "Historical Result",
       size = "County Population")
