title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16, color = historical)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red" = "red", "blue" = "blue", "purple" = "purple")) +
  labs(x = "2016",
       y = "2020",
       title = "Republican Margins of Victory",
       caption = "Point Percentages per County, 2016 and 2020",
       color = "Historical Result")
```
