---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_16, fill = winner_16)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("repub" = "red", "dem" = "blue")) +
  labs(x = "Political Party",
       y = "Counties Won",
       title = "Counties Won per Party in the 2016 Election",
       fill = "Political Party")
```
