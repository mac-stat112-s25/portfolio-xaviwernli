<p><strong>Piece 1: A dataset</strong></p>
<p>This dataset must include either:</p>
<ul>
<li>location coordinates for your points of interest (for point maps); or</li>
<li>variable outcomes for your regions of interest (for choropleth maps)</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Piece 2: A background map</strong></p>
<p>We need latitude and longitude coordinates to specify the boundaries for your regions of interest (eg: countries, states). This is where it gets really sticky!</p>
<ul>
<li>County-level, state-level, country-level, continent-level info live in multiple places.</li>
<li>Where we grab this info <em>can</em> depend upon whether we want to make a point map or a choropleth map. (The background maps can be used somewhat interchangeably, but it requires extra code :/)</li>
<li>Where we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we’re up for. For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map. For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the code for spatial viz gets very specialized. The goal of these exercises is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>play around and experience the wide variety of spatial viz tools out there</li>
<li>understand the difference between point maps and choropleth maps</li>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> is an open-source JavaScript library for creating maps. We can use it inside R through the <code>leaflet</code> package.</p>
<p>This uses a different plotting framework than <code>ggplot2</code>, but still has a <code>tidyverse</code> feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).</p>
<p>The general steps are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a <em>map widget</em> by calling <code>leaflet()</code> and telling it the data to use.</li>
<li>Add a <em>base map</em> using <code>addTiles()</code> (the default) or <code>addProviderTiles()</code>.</li>
<li>Add <em>layers</em> to the map using layer functions (e.g.&nbsp;<code>addMarkers()</code>, <code>addPolygons()</code>).</li>
<li>Print the map widget to <em>display</em> it.</li>

<p>In general:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>addProviderTiles()</code> changes the base map.<br>
To explore all available provider base maps, type <code>providers</code> in the console. (Though some don’t work :/)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>addMarkers()</code> or <code>addCircles()</code> to mark locations. Type <code>?addControl</code> into the console to pull up a help file which summarizes the aesthetics of these markers and how you can change them. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>weight</code> = how thick to make the lines, points, pixels</li>
<li>
<code>opacity</code> = transparency (like <code>alpha</code> in <code>ggplot2</code>)</li>
<li>colors need to be in “hex” form. We used the <code>col2hex()</code> function from the <code>gplots</code> library to do that</li>
</ul>

<p>Leaflet is very powerful and fun. But:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.</li>
<li>It makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s explore how to make point maps with <code>ggplot()</code>, not <code>leaflet()</code>.</p>
</section><section id="exercise-3-a-simple-scatterplot" class="level3 unnumbered"><h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="exercise-3-a-simple-scatterplot">Exercise 3: A simple scatterplot</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the <code>ggplot()</code> tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all <code>starbucks</code> locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)</li>
<li>Make the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what <em>don’t</em> you like about this plot?</p>
<p><em>You can see the shape of the world, but it would be nice to have a simple map overlayed beneath this.</em></p>

<p>In these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (<code>repub_20_categories</code>) that <em>discretizes</em> the <code>repub_pct_20</code> variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):</p>

<p>In these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first.</p>
<p>We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (<code>repub_20_categories</code>) that <em>discretizes</em> the <code>repub_pct_20</code> variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):</p>

<span id="cb80-35"><a href="#cb80-35"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>Where we grab this info can also depend upon the structure of our data and how much data wrangling / cleaning we're up for.</span>
<span id="cb80-36"><a href="#cb80-36"></a>    For choropleth maps, the labels of regions in our data must match those in the background map.</span>
<span id="cb80-37"><a href="#cb80-37"></a>    For example, if our data labels states with their abbreviations (eg: MN) and the background map refers to them as full names in lower case (eg: minnesota), we have to wrangle our data so that it matches the background map.</span>
