    "text": "Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture?\n\n\nIt should capture that the high the number, the higher the difficulty. Also, that the difficulty is correlated to the elevation and milage of the hike.*\n\n\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable?\n\n\nThat this is very high and higher elevation hikes are very difficult.\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. Mainly, we’ve installed the package but need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe?\nthis created a frame where data can be place in *\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function?\nthe name of the data file *\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating?\nso the hikes are placed in the frame in order and not randomly. *\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!?\naxis? Or something to do with the y axis? *\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# This adds the data to the frame, in the form of a bar graph.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# This named the y axis, and capitalized the \"R\" in rating.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This made the graph blue.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This added an orange outline to the graph.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# This changed the background to white.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it?\nit adds another component of the graph, we use it when we want to add more components to the graph. *\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?\nthat is the function name which tells R we are graphing something. *\nWhat does labs() stand for?\nThat names the x and y axis. *\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\ncolor is the outline, fill in the color of the inside of the graph.\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\nthe difficulty of the hikes, and the number of hikes per difficulty category. *\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\nmore than 50% of the hikes are moderate, so there is a lot of variability.\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n\nBy adding a “+” sign I can add components to the graph such as themes, and layers. I can also change the name of the axes, and add color to the bar graph.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\n\nI don’t like how close some of the labels for the x-axis and the bar labels are. *\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\nit is difficult to read, and it’s difficult to view trends in the data. *\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n6 *\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n2 *\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\n\nHistograms help put together raw data so it can be easily viewed and understood. *\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# it is now a histogram!\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n# the color was changed to white, which gives an outline to the histograms, and it is easier to see the different bars.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n\n# the fill color was changed to blue, making everything blue.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n\n# no more fill, x and y axis have been labeled, binwidth has been set. This gives more context to the graph and makes it easier to read.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# binwidth was set to 1000, which is too big to view anything important.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# binwidth was reduced to 5, it is very difficult to read this graph.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n# bindwidth was set to 200, trends in the graph can now be seen.\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry?\nto help the viewer understand the data *\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\ncolor is the outline, fill in the inside color *\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization?\nit adds contrast and helps differentiate the bars. *\nWhat did binwidth do?\nthat changes the width of each bar *\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?\nnot enough data variation is shown *\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?\nit is difficult to read the graph *\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\nthis will change the line to be blue *\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\nthis will make the area under the graph blue *\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\nit was! *\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\", fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\nit shows that the distribution of elevation is skewed right, with the highest density of hikes having 4200ft elevation gain. *\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? * histograms are more accurate, and are easier to read if the viewer would like to make accurate estimates (such as the average elevation of a hike). The density plot is easier to read for trends, as the lines are continuous.\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\nit makes it easier to read! Your brain can spend more time figuring out problems with the code if it doesn’t have to find where the section of the code begins and ends.\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://ajohns24.github.io/data/112/about_us_2024.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\n\nhead(survey)\n\n      cafe_mac minutes_to_campus fave_temp       hangout\n1   Cheesecake                15        18 the mountains\n2 Cheese pizza                10        24       a beach\n3 udon noodles                 4        18 the mountains\n4    egg rolls                 7        10       a beach\n5       Tacos                  5        18 the mountains\n6        pasta                35         7 the mountains\n\n\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = fave_temp)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"black\", fill = \"orange\") +\n  labs(x = \"Favorite Temperature (Celcius)\", y = \"Students\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = repub_pct_16)) +\ngeom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?\n# There are two axis.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number?\n# Wow it changes what the points look like!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 3)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\n# It needs state abbreviations\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong) Very strong relationship\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative) Positive direction\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?) *Most outliers are from Texas, this may have happened because Texas has swung more conservative in recent times.\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(x = median_rent, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(x = median_age, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\nScatterplots are best for comparing quantitative data\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\n*In blue states, republican usually win about ~55% of the counties, compared to ~75% of the counties in red states. In purple states, they usually win ~65%\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\n# *colors do not align, and you can't see what is covered up by red and purple*\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\n# *It gives you the correct colors*\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\n# *It changes the opacity*\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\n# *It seperates the historical groups*\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\n# *Its hard to read, because the values are stacked on top of each other*\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best? The density plots\n\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? Density plots are easier to read, especially for people unfamiliar with statistics\n\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? They don’t display as accurate imformation as boxplots (median and quartiles)\n\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"salmon\", \"turquoise\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\n# *historical is categorical, and winner_20 fills out those categories with info.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\nIts easier to see proportions, and understand changes over time.\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why? I really like the proportional bar plot, because it places proportions in higher importance as count, as count isn’t necessarily important in this visualization.\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"green\", \"blue\", \"orange\"))\n\nWarning: Removed 19 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_density()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\n# *Use the line of best fit as a prediction tool!*\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp9am, y = temp3pm)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 27 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ location)",

    "text": "7.2 Exercises (optional)\nThe above visualizations are foundational and important. But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state. Reflect on why this is bad.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA facet wrap would also be bad!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~ state_abbr)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to compare the distribution of some quantitative outcome among many groups / categories, a ridgeline plot can be a good option. These are also called joy plots, named after the album cover for “Unknown Pleasures” by Joy Division. (Look it up!) To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works? We'll learn about this later in the semester.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n# YOUR TURN: color/fill the ridges according to a state's historical voting patterns \n# and add meaningful axis labels\n\nFollow-up questions\n\nWhich states tend to have the most variability in outcomes from county to county? The least?\nWhat other interesting patterns do you notice?\nDoes this plot prompt any other questions?\nOptional Exercise 2: Total Outcomes by State\nLet’s import some new data and counts up the total votes (Republican and Democratic) by state, not county. This was wrangled from the elections data!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\n\nFor example, we might make a scatterplot of the 2020 vs 2016 outcomes:\n\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT this isn’t the easiest way to communicate or identify the changes from 1 year to the next.\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Start by creating a \"scatterplot\" of state_abbr (y-axis) by 2020 Republican support on the x-axis\n# Color the points red\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Reorder the states in terms of their 2020 Republican support (not alphabet)\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Finally, add ANOTHER layer of points for the 2016 outcomes\n# What info does this new geom_point() layer need to run?\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = state_abbr))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on the following\n\nWhat do you think this plot needs? Try it! You might need to do some digging online.\nSummarize the main takeaways from the plots. Which states changed the most from 2016 to 2020? The least? Where did the Republican support increase? Where did it decrease?\nWhat other questions are you left with?",
